I've released yet another one of my *Mostly Uselessâ„¢* projects, [Fetch](https://github.com/gummesson/fetch "Fetch"), which let's you grab a couple of web development resources straight from the command line. Package managers seem to be something that pops up every once in a while. Among them there's [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ "homebrew"), [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/ "Bower"), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/ "Yeoman") and of course the good old [apt-get](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool "APT"), which I use from time to time. They're lovely tools but as I'm nothing more than a hobbyist they're a bit overkill for me, so I took a run at creating something a lot more simpler. I wouldn't really call it a package manager but more of a component catcher though. I'm thinking of implementing [JSON](http://www.json.org/ "JSON") into it instead of using [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/ "YAML"), but we'll see how that goes. One thing I really need to do is to step up my game and actually start to learn more. I feel that I've been staying in the same spot knowledge-wise for quite some time now and it's time to start to progress again. But I digress.

One a side note, I finally figured out why I couldn't get my [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby") projects to run under [Crunchbang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/ "Crunchbang Linux"). I'd literally forgotten the "whole shebang", ie: `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`, at the start. **Head, prepare to meet desk**.
