So, launch day has finally arrived. This site has been a work in progress for the last couple of weeks and I'm now finally happy, or atleast content, with how it looks. It's been a kind of troublesome yet quite fun ride (it took me some time to learn my ways around [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and all of its' functions and bits and pieces, but now I'm all set, I think).

## Behind The Scenes

Since I don't really know what to write in this post I thought I could write about how I built it and what tools I've used during the process. After all, my tagline contains the word "geekiness". Enjoy it, I guess.

[This site](http://ellengummesson.com/ "ellengummesson.com") is powered by [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). It was built with HTML5 and CSS3 and my own grid system, [Begrider](/projects/begrider). The code was written by hand in [SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/ "SublimeText 2") with the theme [Soda Dark](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Soda Dark"), the color scheme [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme "Tomorrow Theme") and the plugins [Alignment](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/alignment/ "Alignment") and [Prefixr](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/prefixr "Prefixr"). The site uses [Cabin](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Cabin "Cabin") for the headings and [Vollkorn](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Vollkorn "Vollkorn") for nearly all the other types of type. They're provided by [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts "Google Webfonts"). The blog posts (and pages) are written in [Markdown](http://http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown") with [MarkdownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/ "MarkdownPad"). I occasionally use [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/ "iA Writer") too, just to mix things up.

That sums it up pretty nicely, and thus, the link bombing ends here.
