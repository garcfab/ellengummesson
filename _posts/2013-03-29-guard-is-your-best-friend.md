A really nice and short screencast from [Nettuts](http://net.tutsplus.com/ "Nettuts") showcasing how to use [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard "Guard") for file monitoring and task automation. I've hacked together a [Rakefile](https://github.com/gummesson/ellengummesson/blob/master/Rakefile "Rakefile") for similar purposes, but I can definitively see the appeal of it.
