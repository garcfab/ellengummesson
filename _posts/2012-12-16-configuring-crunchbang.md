Since installing [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/ "Crunchbang Linux") two days ago I've spent quite some time on configuring it to my liking. While I find the default look to be quite nice I felt that I needed something with a bit more lighter colors. This is how my current system looks now:

The Openbox theme is called [Elementary for Openbox](http://grvrulz.deviantart.com/art/elementary-for-openbox-253002995 "Elementary for Openbox") while the GTK theme is just called [Elementary](http://danrabbit.deviantart.com/art/elementary-gtk-theme-83104033 "Elementary GTK Theme"). They're both based on the visual style of another Linux distro, [Elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/ "Elementary OS")[^20121216-1]. I threw together the wallpaper by going to [Colourlovers](http://colourlovers.com/ "Colourlovers"), picking two blue-ish colors[^20121216-2] that I liked and using them in as a gradient in [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/ "GIMP") that I drag vertically in the middle of the empty picture. I then configured the default panel [tint2](http://code.google.com/p/tint2/ "tint2") so that it got placed vertically to the left and removed both [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/ "Conky") and [ClipIt](http://clipit.rspwn.com/ "ClipIt") from the autostart script. They're still in the system though since I might have some use for them in the future.
