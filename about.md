My name is Ellen Gummesson and I love communication and the web. I recently recieved a degree in media and communication studies, specialising in strategic communication. Lately I've been diving straight into front-end development, mainly writing HTML5 and CSS3, dabbling a little bit with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery") and starting to really enjoy Javascript. I also like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Syntactically awesome stylesheets") and love [Compass](http://compass-style.org/ "Compass").

I've also started to learn the programming language [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby") and I'm hoping that one day I'll conquer the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Ruby on Rails") framework. In the meantime I'm having fun with micro web framework [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/ "Sinatra"). I enjoy writing small but practically useless [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) "Bash") scripts that I run on my [Manjaro Linux](http://manjaro.org/ "Manjaro Linux") box. You can check out [my projects on Gitub](https://github.com/gummesson/ "My projects on Github") if you'd like, although I'm still very much a beginner when it comes to coding.

## Why are you writing this in english?

I see it both as a fun challenge and an learning experience. English is a pretty important language and even though I think I'm pretty good at both speaking writing it there's always room for improvement.
