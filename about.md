My name is Ellen Gummesson and I love communication and the web. I recently recieved a degree in media and communication studies, specialising in strategic communication. I previously worked as a writer and reviewer for a reasonably large magazine. Lately I've been diving straight into front-end development, mainly writing HTML5, CSS3 and dabbling a little bit with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery"). I also like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Syntactically awesome stylesheets") and love [Compass](http://compass-style.org/ "Compass").

I've also started to learn the programming language [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby") and I'm hoping that one day I'll conquer the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Ruby on Rails") framework. In the meantime I'm having fun with micro web framework [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/ "Sinatra"). I enjoy writing small but practically useless [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) "Bash") scripts that I run on my beloved [Crunchbang Linux](http://crunchbang.org/ "Crunchbang Linux") box. You can check out [my projects](/projects) if you'd like.

## Why are you writing this in english?

I see it both as a fun challenge and an learning experience. English is a pretty important language and even though I think I'm pretty good at both speaking writing it there's always room for improvement.

## Colophon

[This site](http://ellengummesson.com/ "ellengummesson.com") is powered by [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). It was built with HTML5 and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Syntactically awesome stylesheets") with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/ "Compass") on top of [Smallwork](https://github.com/gummesson/smallwork "Smallwork - A small Sass/SCSS framework-like starting point"). The code was written by hand in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim") with the colorscheme [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized "Solarized"). The site makes use of the rather nice looking typeface [Roboto](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Roboto "Roboto"), which is provided by [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts "Google Webfonts"). The colors come from [Noah Frederick's](http://noahfrederick.com/ "Noah Frederick") beautiful terminal theme [Peppermint](http://noahfrederick.com/blog/2011/lion-terminal-theme-peppermint/ "Peppermint").

The blog posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown"), scribbled down in [Pop](http://minimaltools.com/ "Pop"), [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/ "iA Writer") or [ResophNotes](http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html "ResophNotes") before finally ending up and being finished in [FocusWriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/ "FocusWriter"), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim") or occasionally in [MarkdownPad](http://www.mardownpad.com/ "MarkdownPad"). [Shotty](http://shotty.devs-on.net/en/Overview.aspx "Shotty") is used for taking the screenshots.
