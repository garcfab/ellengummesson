My name is Ellen Gummesson and I love communication and the web, especially when the two of them get together. I recently graduated from Umeå University, located in the north of Sweden, where I recieved a Degree of Bachelor of Arts in Media and Communication Studies with a specialisation in strategic communication. I've previously worked as a writer and reviewer for the magazine Nöjesmagasinet City and I'm getting more and more into web design and front-end development, mainly HTML5, CSS3 and a little bit of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery"). I've also started to learn the programming language [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby"). You can check out [my projects](/projects/) if you'd like.

## Why Are You Writing This In English?

I see it both as a fun challenge and an learning experience. English is a pretty important language and even though I think I'm pretty good at both speaking writing it there's always room for improvement.
