My name is Ellen Gummesson and I love communication and the web, especially when the two of them get together. I recently graduated from Umeå University, located in the north of Sweden, where I recieved a degree in media and communication studies. I've previously worked as a writer and reviewer for the magazine Nöjesmagasinet City and I'm getting more and more into web design and front-end development, mainly HTML5, CSS3 and a little bit of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery"). 

I've also started to learn the programming language [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby") and I'm hoping that one day I'll conquer the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Ruby on Rails") framework. In the meantime I'm having fun with micro web-framework [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/ "Sinatra"). You can check out [my projects](/projects) if you'd like.

## Why Are You Writing This In English?

I see it both as a fun challenge and an learning experience. English is a pretty important language and even though I think I'm pretty good at both speaking writing it there's always room for improvement.
