## Jekyll Wordcount Plugin

<p class="smallprint">Ruby</p>

It can also calculate how long it takes to read the post based on the counted words.

## Begrider

<p class="smallprint">CSS/HTML</p>

*Begrider* is a simple, fluid twelve column and ten units grid system with a 1140px fixed width. It works great in Chrome and Firefox and looks alright in Internet Explorer 9. It works in Opera too if you donâ€™t mind that some of the columns are a tiny bit off. The goal behind it was creating something that I could actually use and to make it as simple as possible.
