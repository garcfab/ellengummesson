Here's my humble collection of projects (or rather, demos and snippets).

## Begrider

<p class="margin-small small centered italic">CSS/HTML</p>

*Begrider* is a simple, fluid twelve column and ten units grid system with a 1140px fixed width. It works great in Chrome and Firefox and looks alright in Internet Explorer 9. It works in Opera too if you donâ€™t mind that some of the columns are a tiny bit off. The goal behind it was creating something that I could actually use and to make it as simple as possible.

## Clean Slate For GetSimple CMS

<p class="margin-small small centered italic">CSS/HTML/PHP</p>

*Clean Slate* is a bare bones starter theme for [GetSimple CMS](http://www.get-simple.info/ "GetSimple CMS"). It contains some minimal markup, a basic reset and a couple of [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki "Object Oriented CSS")-inspired classes to get you started, but that's it.

## Jekyll Rake Boilerplate

*Jekyll Rake Boilerplate* is a small rake "boilerplate" for doing common tasks with the static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), such as generating your site (with an optional post limit), creating a new post from a default template and deploying it to it's remote git repository or a remote host/server.

*Jekyll Vimeo Plugin* is a plugin for [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") that makes it easy to embed videos from Vimeo by using a simple Liquid tag.
