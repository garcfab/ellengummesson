title: FocusWriter Themes

Here's a couple of themes I created for the excellent free text editor [FocusWriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/ "FocusWriter"). They're based on some popular color schemes from various other editors.

## Typeface

The themes use the font **DejaVu Sans Mono**, which is available [here](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page "DejaVu Fonts"). It also comes pre-installed with *Windows* and a couple of *Linux* distros. If you're using *OSX* and don't feel like downloading it, **Menlo** is a great alternative.

### iA Writer
*iA Writer* is based on [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/ "iA Writer") from [Information Architects](http://informationarchitects.net/ "Information Architects").

*Background (RGB):* `242, 242, 244`  
*Text (RGB):* `91, 91, 93`
